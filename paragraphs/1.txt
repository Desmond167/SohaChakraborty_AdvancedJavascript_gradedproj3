If I would be in the place of the Patrick I would try not to play all time instead try to work hard than hardest for completing my homework for the first day of the beginning of the semester itself instead of playing games like basketball or even baseball. If even I was in the Patrick's place I would have asked that little person to complete my homework because I know I hate homework and I will never be able to do it until and unless any one would accompany me to do it. Even when lastly after the 35 days the semester completed I would really be thankful to the little one who changed my opinion on the homework.
